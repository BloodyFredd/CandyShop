# CandyShop
This site, as the name suggests, is a candy shop.
We have users, managers and "view-only" guests. Each one of those parties have unique pages that are available for them.
For example, if you are a guest, you can search the candies but cannot add a new candy. While only the manager can add a new candy to our database.

This project was built as an ASP.NET site using MVC architecture.
Me and a friend (Omri Avidan) wrote this site as part of a project in Network course.
We wrote this site in C# and we used Sql-Server 2012 in order to store all the data from our site.
In order to save the data we used Microsoft Framework Entity Code First.
We used jQuery in order to do some asynchronous actions.
In order to make the site eye freindly we used bootstrap 4.
